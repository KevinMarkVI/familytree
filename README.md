Family Tree Project


This project contains a tree data structure (tree.js), a family tree class built on the tree data structure (familyTree.js), and a class for implementing a few Family Tree queries (familyTreeQueries.js). These files are all in the src folder. Each of these files has a related file containing tests for the class and they are labled Spec in the tests folder.

To run the tests simply open the file specRunner.html in the browser.
